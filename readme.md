## Features

The Snipcart plugin brings tighter Snipcart integration to Craft CMS for easier setup and greater flexibility with minimal custom development.

- Use an optional Field Type and handy Twig tags to make store setup a breeze.
- Browse Snipcart orders, customers, and subscriptions from the Craft CMS control panel.
- Create discounts and issue refunds from the Craft CMS control panel.
- View sales statistics from the Craft CMS dashboard.
- Set up webhooks to have full control over order emails, shipping rates, inventory, and just about anything you can think up.
- Get live shipping rates at checkout with Snipcart's FedEx, USPS, UPS, Purolator, Canada Post and Australia Post integrations.
- Calculate exact taxes at checkout with Snipcart's TaxCloud and TaxJar integrations.

If Commerce Pro is too complex for your project and Commerce Lite is bit too limiting, Snipcart will be a great fit.

*: Snipcart is a hosted service with [its own service fee](https://snipcart.com/pricing), and all three options require payment gateway fees.  
**: Commerce [has first-party support for seven payment gateways](https://docs.craftcms.com/commerce/v2/payment-gateways.html) and [Snipcart supports nine](https://snipcart.com/list-ecommerce-payment-gateways). An important difference is that Commerce can support more gateways and functionality via plugins.  
***: Snipcart offers a highly-customizable cart template that you can customize however much you'd like.
