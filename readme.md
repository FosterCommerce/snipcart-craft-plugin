## Features

The Snipcart plugin brings tighter Snipcart integration to Craft CMS for easier setup and greater flexibility with minimal custom development.

- An optional Field Type and Twig tags make store setup fast.
- Browse Snipcart orders, customers, and subscriptions from the Craft CMS control panel.
- Create discounts and issue refunds from the Craft CMS control panel.
- View sales statistics from control panel section and configurable dashboard widgets.
- Set up webhooks to have full control over order emails, shipping rates, inventory, and just about anything you can think up.
- Detailed modeled Snipcart and ShipStation models make custom development faster more convenient if you've not worked with Snipcart before.
- Get live shipping rates at checkout with Snipcart's FedEx, USPS, UPS, Purolator, Canada Post and Australia Post integrations.
- Calculate exact taxes at checkout with Snipcart's TaxCloud and TaxJar integrations.
- Integrate directly with ShipStation to get live shipping rates and pass on completed orders for shipping.

If Commerce Pro is too complex for your project and Commerce Lite is bit too limiting, Snipcart will be a great fit.

*: Snipcart is a hosted service with [its own service fee](https://snipcart.com/pricing), and all three options require payment gateway fees.  
**: Commerce [has first-party support for seven payment gateways](https://docs.craftcms.com/commerce/v2/payment-gateways.html) and [Snipcart supports nine](https://snipcart.com/list-ecommerce-payment-gateways). **But** Commerce supports more gateways via plugins.  
***: Snipcart offers a highly-customizable cart template that you can customize however much you'd like.
