# ShipStation

The Snipcart plugin offers basic integration with [ShipStation](https://www.shipstation.com/), a third-party service that can be used to get rates, print postage, manage inventory, or even manage multiple warehouses and a whole fulfillment process. This integration can be used to get live shipping rates directly from ShipStation, and send Snipcart orders to ShipStation once they're completed.

At the moment, ShipStation integration can only be configured in a static config. See the `providers` section in the [static config example](/examples/config.md) and reach out if you need help getting this set up.
