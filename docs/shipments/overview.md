# Overview

The Snipcart plugin currently offers basic integration with [ShipStation](https://www.shipstation.com/), a third-party service that can be used to get rates, print postage, manage inventory, or even manage multiple warehouses and a whole fulfillment process. More providers will be supported later. This integration can be used to get live shipping rates directly from ShipStation, as well as send Snipcart orders to ShipStation once they're completed.
